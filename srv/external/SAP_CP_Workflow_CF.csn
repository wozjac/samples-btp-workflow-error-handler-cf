With the API, you can, for example, start new workflow instances and work with tasks.\n\nNote (relevant only for SAP API Business Hub): For authentication purposes, the API uses OAuth 2.0 security (with JSON Web Token, JWT). Thus, \"Try Out\" only works with an explicitly configured environment.\nFor more information on how to obtain the necessary parameters, please see [Determine Service Configuration Parameters](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/abb1f66b2c3b4983b6b656654cfc3d2b.html) in the documentation.\nThe OAuth client you use must have [extended scopes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/baf2847f6d1c401a83ca3a1427b8ff84.html).\n\nNote: These APIs are designed for loosely coupled clients. This means:\n\n- If workflow service adds fields to responses, the API version number does not increase. Your client must ignore new fields.\n- The order of fields in responses and of entries in arrays may change. This applies unless the API provides an explicit means to specify the desired order.\n"

This is valid as well for other APIs and the processing according to the workflow definition.\n\n* Workflow instances in CANCELED status stop processing as soon as the system allows.\n\nWhen you are changing the status to SUSPENDED, note the following:\n\n* Status SUSPENDED manually and temporarily suspends processing.\n\n* You can choose to suspend the specified instance or the whole cascade by setting boolean parameter \"cascade\". By default, the parameter is false. When set to true, the operation is cascaded to its referenced subflow instances.\n\n* Workflow instances in SUSPENDED status stop processing as soon as the system allows.\n\n* Workflow instances remain in SUSPENDED status until a status change to RUNNING or CANCELED is requested.\n\n* While the workflow instance status reported by the respective API might change with immediate effect, follow-up actions might only be successful, after asynchronous processing within the workflow instance actually has stopped. To check whether asynchronous processing is ongoing, analyze the execution logs or check the workflow definition structure.\n\nWhen you are changing the status to RUNNING, note the following:\n\n* For workflow instances in ERRONEOUS status, this retries the failed activities. If these activities continue failing, the workflow instance automatically moves again into ERRONEOUS status.\n\n* If the workflow instance had previously been suspended while in ERRONEOUS status, failed activities, such as service tasks, are retried.\n\n* You can choose to retry or resume the specified instance or the whole cascade by setting boolean parameter \"cascade\".
